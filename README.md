The application is designed for administration of the hierarchical permissions. 
Each permission has a unique name with the 5 letter characters long, 
which is generated by the generator and stored in a separate table in the database. 
At the permission creation, the permission name is assigned automatically. 
Each permission can have an arbitrary amount of sub-permissions, and the tree depth is 3.
The UI part works in the next way: the page is loaded and the user can create first level permissions,
which are immediately displayed on the UI. To create sub-permissions, use the "Plus" button.
To view the level below, use the "Folder" button of the current level.
To create a child level, use the " Plus" button of the current (parent) level.
To view the child permissions of the second level, use the "Folder" button, which displays the sub-permissions.
To remove use the "Trash" button. Removing a parent level removes all of its child levels.
